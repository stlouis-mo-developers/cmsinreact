## Introduction
In this section we will cover:
- Why do we use or code in ReactJS?
- What do we need to code in ReactJS?
- Who Am I?

### Why code in ReactJS?
- React is an open source JavaScript framework that is used for building the front-ends or user interfaces for single-page applications
because it can update sections of the front-end (based on data changes) without reloading the entire page. 
- React is the most popular JavaScript library / framework used in building the frontends / user interface (UI) / view layer for
both web and mobile applications. 
- React simplifies and/or facilitates the breaking down of our View Layer / User Interface into distinct sections (components) that 
can be worked on independently and/or re-used across our web / mobile app project. For example, a component that displays a copyright notice in a footer element can be designed & written once and then reused on any page of our wesbite / mobile app without having to code it each time!


### What you need to code in ReactJS?
You will need a development environment (windows / mac / linux) that is setup for React development. An environment like that will have the following installed ...
- Node
- NPM
- Git
- Visual Studio Code or any other JavaScript development tool 
- React.JS library 

### Who Am I?
My name is Kingsley Tagb and I am a software developer with more than 10+ years of designing, architecting & coding 
enterprise Web, mobile & desktop applications using multiple software frameworks including React.JS

## How To Setup a ReactJS Development Environment?
Follow the steps below to setup your React environment by performing the following tasks
- Install & Learn About Node & NPM
- Install & Learn About Git
- Install & Learn About Visual Studio Code
- Install & Learn About React

#### [Home](#table-of-contents)

### Install or Learn About Node
- `Node.js` is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine and it was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
- `Node` is also an open source, cross-platform (mac, windows, linux) environment for developing and/or running software applications. 
- `Node` applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime, as in on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
- `Node.js` also provides a rich library of JavaScript modules (code) which simplifies the development of applications
- `Download & Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

#### [Home](#table-of-contents)


### Learn About NPM
- `npm` is the world's largest online code repository  and is used for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.
- `npm` is also available as a local command-line utility for interacting with its online repository and as a software package installation, version management and dependency management environment. 
- There are lots of Node.js software libraries and/or applications published on npm and they can be searched for on `https://www.npmjs.com`. 
- Anytime you have a software package that you want to install, it can be installed with a single command-line NPM command.
- `Learn More`: https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/

#### [Home](#table-of-contents)


### Install or Learn About GIT
- Git is a software that is used for tracking changes in any set of files and also for co-ordinating coding work among programmers and for collaboratively developing source code. 
- Git makes collaboration between developers easier by managing changes from multiple developers so it can all be be merged into one source code. 
- Git is the most commonly used software version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
- Git is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are stored on your computer. You can also use online Git hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) to store a copy of the files and their revision history. Having shared locations where you can upload your changes and/or download changes from others, helps you collaborate more easily with other developers. 
- Git can also help with merge multiple changes from two or more people without losing each otherâ€™s work!
- Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of Linux.
`Download & Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads`

### Install or Learn About ReactJS?
`React.js` is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building frontends or user interfaces for single-page applications.
- React helps developers create fast / large web applications that can show, reflect or react to data changes, without reloading the entire page!

### What Is Create React App?
Create-React-App is a command-line tool from Facebook that allows you to quickly & easily generate a new React project from the command-line 
without spending a lot of time setting up your local build, development & testing environment.
React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook.
This project was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to install ReactJS
- run `npm install -g react@latest react-dom@latest` on your development machine's command line (with Node installed)
- Create a new React Project using Create React App by running a command like: 

```
<code>
`npx create-react-app reactjs-lesson-one-multi-tenant --template typescript
</code>
```

## How To Code in ReactJS

### Why Do We Use Components in ReactJS?
Components are the core building blocks of React Frontends / User Interfaces (UIs), Websites or Apps. 
So, developing an application in React means breaking down your app into multiple, independent, reusable sections (components)
so that they can be worked on in-isolation and then merged later into a final parent component!
Some of the typical components you will find in a ReactJS app incude:
- App Component
- Header Component
- Footer Component
- Login Component

### What Is JSX?
`JSX` stands for `Javascript XML` and is the React syntax / language extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML like tags inside JavaScript!
- Browsers do not understand JSX beacuse it's not valid Javascript syntax and so, we need a tool like `Bablel` to transform / compile `JSX` 
syntax into Javasript functions that the browser can understand and execute! 
- Each JSX tag is compiled into a Javascript `React.createElement` function call which is a plain Javascript function that browsers support  / understand.


#### [Home](#table-of-contents)


#### What does JSX look like?
- A JSX expression starts with a HTML-like opening tag, and also ends with its closing tag. You can leave out the closing tag if there are no children
- JSX expressions are written inside curly braces { }. Expressions are variables or any valid JavaScript expressions.
```
<code>
export function App() {
  const name = "Kingsley Tagbo";
  
  return (
    <div className="App" id="App">
      <h3> Hi {name} </h3>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```

#### How to comment out JSX?
- Regular JavaScript comments in JSX are displayed as text. So, you can't use a plain JavaScript comment like this:
```
<code>
 <!-- This comments out code in plain JavaScript but not in JSX -->
</code>
```

- Place your JSX statements inside of Curly braces like this: {/* commented out statement */}.
- Here is a single line JSX Comment
```
<code>
{/* I'm a single line JSX commented out code */}
</code>
```

- Here is a multi line JSX Comment
```
<code>
{/* 
  I am a multi
  line
  commented out code
*/}  
</code>
```


- Here is an example of JSX Comment in a React App. When you run this, nothing will showup on the screen
```
<code>
export function App() {
  const name = "Kingsley Tagbo";
  return (
    <div id="App">
      {/* <h3> Hi {name} </h3> */}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```

#### How to write math in JSX?
- The code below demonstrates how you can create basic math expressions in JSX:
```
<code>
export function App() {
  const multiply = 5 * 5;
  return (
    <div id="App">
      <div> 
        5 * 5 is {multiply} <br/>
        5 + 5 is {5 + 5} <br/>
        5 - 5 is {5 - 5} <br/>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```
#### [Home](#table-of-contents)


#### How to code nested HTML elements in JSX?
- Multiple nested HTML elements must be wrapped in ONE top level element for a valid JSX expression.
- In the tutorial below, there is one top-level / containing `DIV` HTML tag 
```
<code>
export function App() {
  const multiply = 5 * 5;
  return (
    <div id="App">
      <div> 
        <p>5 * 5 is {multiply} </p>
        <h3>5 + 5 is {5 + 5} </h3>
        <div><strong>5 - 5 is {5 - 5} </strong></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```

- Alternatively, you can use a `fragment` to wrap multiple nested lines of HTML
- A fragment looks like an empty HTML tag `<></>`.   
- In the tutorial below, there is one top-level fragment `<>` tag 
```
<code>
export function App() {
  const multiply = 5 * 5;
  return (
    <div id="App">
      <> 
        <p>5 * 5 is {multiply} </p>
        <h3>5 + 5 is {5 + 5} </h3>
        <div><strong>5 - 5 is {5 - 5} </strong></div>
      </>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```

### How To Create Your First Component?
- If you used the `Create React App` or the `git clone fom repo-url` method, you already have the first component created for you.
- Your first component is also known as the App component and is contained within your `src` folder.
- Open your `App.tsx` file and you will find a ReactJS function that declares your App Component. 
- So, there are two types of components that we can create in ReactJs based on how it uses `State`. State is data that we bring into a component that ends up being used, changed or even presented in the User Interface 
    - A `Functional component` or `stateless component` or `dumb component` is a JavaScript function that accepts an argument or input named props and returns a React element. Functional components don't have or hold their own `State`
    - A `class component` or `stateful component`or `smart component` is a React component that holds or maintains its own `State`.

### App Component
 - `Create React App` by default generates your first component as a functional component inside the `App.tsx` file
 - The App.tsx file consists of import statements at the beginning, the App component in the middle, and an export statement at the bottom. 

 The import statements at the top of the file `App.tsx` provides us with code that has been created some where. 
Here is what it looks like ... 
```
<code>
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
</code>
```

- The first statement finds the default export from the NodeJS React library and imports that as constant named React 
- The second statement imports a logo from './logo.svg'. 
- The third statement imports the stylesheets / CSS for your ReactJS App component 
- The App component
- After all the imports, you have a functional compponent named App. Here is what it looks like ...

```
<code>
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
</code>
```

- Export statements
At the bottom of your App.tsx file, you will find a default export statement that makes your App component available to other modules. Here is what the code looks like ...
```
<code>
export default App;
</code>
```

### How To Create a Footer Component?
- The footer at the bottom of a website typically contains a copyright notice and other needed HTML markup
- All the HTML functionality in the Footer section can be seperated out into a `Footer` component placed inside a sub folder at `./components/Footer.tsx`
- The HTML / JSX Markup can then be exported from the Footer component and imported into the `App` component where it can be dispalyed
- The Tutorial below demonstrates a simple Footer component created inside `./components/Footer.tsx`
- All the HTML functionality in the Footer section can be seperated out into a `Footer` component placed inside a sub folder at `./components/Footer.tsx`
- The Footer `function component` receives parameters (params). In this tutorial, the App `parent` component sends a custom title (parameter) which is received by the `child` footer component and displayed with `JSX` in the Footer.tsx as `<p>Copyright &copy; {params.title}</p>`
- SO, a parent component `App.tsx` can pass information / data to an enclosed `child` component using function parameters
- In another section, we will review creating function components using `ES5` vs. `ES6` syntax
```
<code>
function Footer(params: any) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright &copy; {params.title}</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
export default Footer;
</code>
```

- The Tutorial below shows how the footer component is included and reused in the React App
```
<code>
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import Footer from './components/Footer';


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
      <Footer title={'Kingsley Tagbo'}></Footer>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

</code>
```

## The JavaScript Language
### ES5 vs ES6
- `ECMAScript` is a standardard for the JavaScript language.
- `ES5` is an ECMAScript / Javascript standard and is also known as `ECMAScript 5` or `ECMAScript 2009`
- `ES6` is also an ECMAScript / Javascript standard and is also known as `ECMAScript 6` or `ECMAScript 2015`

#### ES5 Function Components
- We can declare ES5 functions as a `named function` or as an `anonymous function`
- The tutorial below shows a named es5 function ...
```
<code>
function FooterNamed(params: any) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright &copy; {params.title}</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
export default FooterNamed;
</code>
```

- The tutorial below demonstrates using an anonymous es5 function ...
- `Named Functio` declarations are `hoisted` by the browser to the top of your code and interpreted before other code is executed. This also means that you can call a named function before youâ€™ve declared that function in your code
```
<code>
const FooterAnonymous = function (params: any) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright &copy; {params.title}</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
export default FooterAnonymous;
</code>
```

#### ES6 Function Components
- ES6 introduces `arrow functions`which allows us to write conciseee xpressions without the `function` keyword.
- In ES6, functions are writen using an arrow to the right of a parentheses which contains your parameters as in the tutorial below    ...
```
<code>
const FooterArrow = (params: any) => {
  return (
        <footer>
          <p>Copyright &copy; {params.title}</p>
        </footer>
  );
}
export default FooterArrow;
</code>
```

# GIT STUP
 - git remote add origin-cmsinreact https://github.com/stlouis-mo-developers/cmsinreact.git
 - git remote -v
 - git pull origin-cmsinreact main --allow-unrelated-histories
 - git push origin-cmsinreact

## Tips

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
